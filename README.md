# Hilde CNC

This repository contains the documentation and wiring diagrams for my CNC machine, Hilde CNC. The documentation is written in Typst and some wiring diagrams are made with WireViz.

This docummentation is specific to my machine, but you might find some parts useful for your own CNC projects.
